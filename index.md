# Projects


## Bachelor's thesis - Test Case Generation Using Fuzzing in C++

I was introduced to **LLVM** compiler infrustructure and studied the LibFuzzer library. I used an idea to implement a program which uses **Clang**'s SanitizerCoverage library 


## Online compiler for Clean language

While working as an assistant at ELTE, I created an online compiler for functional programming language Clean (relative of Haskell). Backend in scala and frontend in Angular, using monaco editor.


## Turing Machine

Implemented with Angular in several hours, works with multiple tapes

# Software Development Practices


## TDD

I'm trying my best to always have my code well tested and covered. Most of my thesis was written using TDD **TODO link** and I used it for most of other projects as well **TODO? link clean compiler**


## Continuous integration & deployment

I've used gitlab's integrated <span class="underline">&#x2026;</span>. For a school project, my team was using an AWS instance for the giltab runner.


# Languages & Environmnets


## C++

<span class="underline">&#x2026;</span> I've attended 


## Scala

I worked primarily with Scala at Wanari and am still in love with it. I was introduced to **Akka** framework (streams, actor system, HTTP) and **shapeless** library briefly


## Javascript, Typescript

I did several small projects with **Node**, **Angular** and **Vue**. 


## Python

I've used it for personal scripts (for linux) and reddit crawlers.


## Lisp

I have very little knowledge, mostly basic Elisp for configuring my emacs **TODO link init file** but I love the language a lot.


# other

I have several years of marketing & social media experience, as well as some other areas I won't be mentioning because of not being very relevant
