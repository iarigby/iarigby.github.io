## What I'm interested in

C++, Scala, Haskell, Rust, Java, Python, Javascript, DevOps, Systems Programming & Linux, Computer Networks, Research (in computer science or aid with programming parts of natural/humanitarian sciences)

# Projects


<a id="org3c09a3e"></a>

## Bachelor's thesis - Test Case Generation Using Fuzzing in C++

I was introduced to **LLVM** compiler infrustructure and studied the LibFuzzer library. I used an idea to implement a program which uses **Clang**'s SanitizerCoverage library 


<a id="org803b8dc"></a>

## Online compiler for Clean language

While working as an assistant at ELTE, I created an online compiler for functional programming language Clean (relative of Haskell). Backend in scala and frontend in Angular, using monaco editor.


<a id="orgd14fa07"></a>

## Turing Machine

Implemented with Angular in several hours, works with multiple tapes


<a id="orgec2cbaf"></a>

<a id="org537ac44"></a>

# Software Development Practices


<a id="orgba45a4d"></a>

## TDD

I'm trying my best to always have my code well tested and covered. Most of my thesis was written using TDD **TODO link** and I used it for most of other projects as well **TODO? link clean compiler**


<a id="org7d95a0e"></a>

## Continuous integration & deployment

I've used gitlab's integrated <span class="underline">&#x2026;</span>. For a school project, my team was using an AWS instance for the giltab runner.


<a id="org8bdf19b"></a>

# Languages & Environmnets


<a id="org638682a"></a>

## C++

<span class="underline">&#x2026;</span> I've attended 


<a id="org84eb4fa"></a>

## Scala

I worked primarily with Scala at Wanari and am still in love with it. I was introduced to **Akka** framework (streams, actor system, HTTP) and **shapeless** library briefly


<a id="orgcf1e004"></a>

## Javascript, Typescript

I did several small projects with **Node**, **Angular** and **Vue**. 


<a id="orge0b16f8"></a>

## Python

I've used it for personal scripts (for linux) and reddit crawlers.


<a id="orgd8e316b"></a>

## Lisp

I have very little knowledge, mostly basic Elisp for configuring my emacs **TODO link init file** but I love the language a lot.


<a id="orgf9e9f2a"></a>

# other

I have several years of marketing & social media experience, as well as some other areas I won't be mentioning because of not being very relevant
