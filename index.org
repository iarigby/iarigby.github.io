** About me
As you will see on this page, I have a diverse set of interests and have small experience in each one of them. I love being introduced to new things or improving my knowledge in areas I already like, so I'm open in exploring anything, including (but not limited to):

C++, Scala, Haskell, Rust, Java, Python, Javascript, DevOps, Systems Programming & Linux, Computer Networks, Research (in computer science or aid with programming parts of natural/humanitarian sciences) 
* Experience  
*** Education
- Computer Science, ELTE Budapest 2016-2019
>>>>>>> I'm too lazy to run git diff
*** Work
- Junior Scala Developer @ Wanari 2018.03-2019.01
- C++ Developer @ Ericsson 2018
*** Other
- Assistant in Functional Programming at ELTE
- Volunteer at 2018 BlackRock hackathon
- Participant at HackETHon (Ericsson) 2019

* Extracurricular Activities
**
** 2018 Scala Pair Programming meetups
* Projects
*** Bachelor thesis - Test Case Generation Using Fuzzing in C++
I was introduced to *LLVM* compiler infrustructure and studied the LibFuzzer library. I used an idea to implement a program which uses *Clang*'s SanitizerCoverage library 
*** Online compiler for Clean language
While working as an assistant at ELTE, I created an online compiler for functional programming language Clean (relative of Haskell). Backend in scala and frontend in Angular, using monaco editor.
*** Turing Machine
Implemented with Angular in several hours, works with multiple tapes

* Languages & Environmnets
*** C++
_..._ I've attended workshop, meetup and public lecture by Bjarne Stroustroup when he was visiting Budapest in May
*** Scala
I worked primarily with Scala at Wanari and am still in love with it. I was introduced to *Akka* framework (streams, actor system, HTTP) and *shapeless* library briefly
*** Javascript, Typescript
I did several small projects with *Node*, *Angular* and *Vue*. 
*** Python
I've used it for personal scripts (for linux) and reddit crawlers.
*** Lisp
I have very little knowledge, mostly basic Elisp for configuring my emacs *TODO link init file* but I love the language a lot.

* Software Development Practices
*** TDD
I'm trying my best to always have my code well tested and covered. Most of my thesis was written using TDD *TODO link* and I used it for most of other projects as well *TODO? link clean compiler*
*** CI & CD
I've used gitlab's integrated DevOps on several personal projects. For a school assignment, my team was using an AWS *Docker* instance for the giltab runner for building and deploying.
* other
I have several years of marketing & social media experience, as well as some other areas I won't be mentioning because of not being very relevant
